## Covid - EDA Project ##

# Date: 13th June 2020

# In this repo, I will be saving all my analytical data work related to the Covid-19 dataset.

# 1. Initial Task

# 2. Outline for the Project


### b. Data Required
Because of our company's global footprint, we will need as much data as we can get on the current situation across the globe. This means that scraping data, going to well-known sources of information such as the World Health Organization, the World Bank, Governments websites, etc., is all fair game.
### c. Cleaning & Manipulation
This part will depend on the data available.
### d. Description and Visualisation
This will depend on the data available but we will definitely want to see trends, distributions, max and min values around the peak weeks, and many averages.
### e. Report findings
In the pipeline.
